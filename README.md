#### Continuous Deployment Pipeline Overview

This project demonstrates a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline built with Jenkins to automate the full software delivery process â€” from code commit to live deployment. Once a push is made to the main branch on GitHub, a configured webhook triggers the Jenkins pipeline automatically.

#### Key Features

  - Cloning of a GitHub repository
  - Installation of required Node.js dependencies
  - Execution of automated integration tests
  - Continuous Deployment (CD) to Render upon successful test completion
  - Slack integration for build and deployment notifications
   

#### Requirements to Run Project Locally

- Node.js v18+
- npm
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Jenkins
- ngrok 
- Github webhook
- Slack
